# Backend File Upload Issue - Solution

## Problem Identified
Your backend is not processing file uploads correctly. When testing the `/upload` endpoint, it returns "WebSocket server is running" instead of processing the file.

## Root Cause
The `multer` dependency is not installed on your deployed backend on Render.com.

## Solution

### Step 1: Update Backend package.json
Your backend `package.json` should include multer:
```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "uuid": "^11.1.0",
    "ws": "^8.18.3",
    "multer": "^1.4.5-lts.1"
  }
}
```

### Step 2: Redeploy Backend
1. Go to your Render.com dashboard
2. Find your backend service
3. Trigger a manual redeploy
4. Wait for deployment to complete

### Step 3: Test File Upload
After redeployment, test the file upload:
```bash
curl -X POST -F "file=@test.txt" https://local-chat-be.onrender.com/upload
```

You should get a JSON response like:
```json
{
  "id": "uuid",
  "filename": "timestamp-random-originalname",
  "originalName": "test.txt",
  "size": 123,
  "mimetype": "text/plain"
}
```

### Step 4: Test Frontend
1. Your `.env.local` file is already configured correctly
2. Restart your frontend development server
3. Test file sharing in the chat app

## Current Status
- ✅ Frontend configuration is correct
- ✅ Backend is running and accessible
- ❌ Backend missing multer dependency
- ⏳ Waiting for backend redeployment

## Quick Test
Open `debug-file-upload.html` in your browser and test the file upload step. It should work after you redeploy the backend.
